## Lead Selection Criteria

### High Relevance (Sauna fit)
- Drowning in fragmented tools (email, docs, CRM, Slack) with no unified context
- Complains about brittle automation (Zapier/Make breaking, RPA scripts failing)
- Manual coordination that never compounds
- Hard to delegate because instructions/context aren't preserved
- Re-explaining "why/what/how" across threads and docs
- Ops/operations teams stitching many tools together

### Medium Relevance
- SaaS founder or PM interested in automation
- Power user of ChatGPT/Cursor looking for persistent context
- Early adopter of productivity/AI tools

### Low Relevance
- General interest in AI or automation
- Information seeking without specific problem mention
