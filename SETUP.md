## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Claude Desktop** or **Claude CLI**
  - Download from: https://claude.ai/download
  - Make sure you're logged in

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
  - Verify installation: `node --version`

- **Reddit Account**
  - You'll need to be logged into Reddit in your browser
  - Account should be in good standing (not new or flagged)

### Recommended

- Basic understanding of Markdown
- Familiarity with Reddit communities
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auto-commenter.git
cd auto-commenter
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: MCP Setup (Browser Automation)

**For Cursor IDE:** Use **cursor-ide-browser** MCP (built-in or in user MCP config). Playwright MCP hits "User rejected MCP" with no approval UI in Cursor — cursor-ide-browser works without this bug.

**For Claude Desktop:** Check that `.mcp/settings.json` exists and contains:

```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@playwright/mcp@latest"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Configuration

### Step 1: Configure Target Subreddits

Edit `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/subreddits.md`:

1. Keep or remove the example subreddits
2. Add your target subreddits
3. For each subreddit, document:
   - Core community rules
   - Community nature
   - Good topics to answer

**Example:**

```markdown
### r/YourSubreddit

| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Core Community Rules** | • No self-promotion<br>• Be helpful |
| **Community Nature** | • Supportive community<br>• Mix of beginners and experts |
| **Good Topics to Answer** | • Getting started questions<br>• Tool recommendations |
```

### Step 2: Configure Product Information

Edit `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/product.md`:

Replace the template with your actual product information:

1. Core value proposition
2. Target customer pain points
3. Competitor comparison
4. Reddit-friendly descriptions

**Keep it concise and authentic.**

## Creating Your Personalization File

This is the **most important step** - it makes your comments sound like you, not an AI.

### Step 1: Collect Your Comments

Go to Reddit and find 8-10 comments you've written that represent your style:

**Selection Criteria:**
- ✅ Various topics
- ✅ Various lengths (1 sentence to several paragraphs)
- ✅ Various tones (helpful, critical, analytical, humorous)
- ✅ Comments you're proud of
- ❌ Don't pick only your "best" formal comments
- ❌ Include natural, casual comments too

### Step 2: Analyze Your Style

Open Claude and provide this prompt:

```
I need you to analyze my Reddit commenting style and create a personalization guide.

Here are 10 comments I wrote on Reddit:

[Comment 1]
---
[Comment 2]
---
[Comment 3]
---
(continue for all comments)

Please analyze:
1. My core writing characteristics (tone, sentence structure, vocabulary)
2. Frequently used expressions
3. Expressions I avoid
4. 6-8 style patterns I use (with examples)
5. How I approach different types of posts (humor, questions, discussions)

Then create a personalization guide following this structure:
[paste the structure from personalization_reddit.md template]
```

### Step 3: Review and Refine

Claude will generate a personalization guide. Review it and:

1. Check if the patterns match your style
2. Add any missing characteristics
3. Remove anything that doesn't sound like you
4. Add examples from your actual comments

### Step 4: Save the File

Save the personalization guide as:
`.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/personalization_reddit.md`

**⚠️ Important:** This file contains your personal style. Don't commit it to GitHub if it has identifying information.

## First Run

### Test Single Comment

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Make sure you're logged into Reddit in your browser
3. In Claude, say:

   ```
   Write one comment on r/YourSubreddit using the reddit-commenter skill
   ```

4. Claude will:
   - Check your tracking file
   - Navigate to the subreddit
   - Find a suitable post
   - Analyze the post
   - Write a comment in your style
   - Review it against the checklist
   - Post it
   - Update tracking

### Verify Results

1. Check that comment was posted on Reddit
2. Review the tracking file: `tracking/reddit/[today's-date].md`
3. Verify the comment sounds like you

### If Something Goes Wrong

- Check that you're logged into Reddit
- **Cursor:** Use cursor-ide-browser MCP (Playwright hits "User rejected MCP" with no approval UI)
- **Claude Desktop:** Verify Playwright MCP is installed: `npx @playwright/mcp@latest --version`
- Make sure personalization file exists
- Check Claude's error messages

---

## Batch Mode Setup

Once single comments work:

### Step 1: Review Quotas

Check `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/subreddits.md` daily limits:

```markdown
| Subreddit | Daily Limit |
|-----------|-------------|
| r/SubredditA | 3 |
| r/SubredditB | 3 |
```

**Recommendation:** Start with 2-3 subreddits, 3 comments each

### Step 2: Run Batch Mode

```
Fill today's quota using the reddit-commenter skill
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

Claude will:
- Report progress after each subreddit
- Skip subreddits with no suitable posts
- Provide a completion report

**Expected duration:** varies by subreddit

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't find personalization file"

**Solution:**
- Make sure file exists at: `.claude/skills/reddit-commenter/resources/personalization_reddit.md`
- Check file name spelling (including `.md` extension)

### "Page loading failed"

**Possible causes:**
1. Internet connection issue
2. Reddit is down
3. MCP server not running

**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Visit Reddit manually to verify it's up
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Reinstall MCP: `npm install`

### "Comment posting failed"

**Possible causes:**
1. Not logged into Reddit
2. Account rate limited
3. Comment violates subreddit rules

**Solutions:**
- Log into Reddit in your browser
- Wait 30 minutes if rate limited
- Review subreddit rules in `subreddits.md`

### "Comments don't sound like me"

**Solution:**
- Review your personalization file
- Add more examples of your actual comments
- Be more specific in the "Expressions to Use/Avoid" sections
- Test with single comments and refine

### "Rate limit detected"

**This is normal.** Reddit has rate limits to prevent spam.

**Solutions:**
- Wait 30 minutes
- Reduce daily quota

## Best Practices

### Start Small

- Begin with 1-2 subreddits
- Post 2-3 comments per day
- Gradually increase as you get comfortable

### Monitor Quality

- Regularly review your comments on Reddit
- Check if they sound natural
- Refine personalization file based on feedback
- Don't sacrifice quality for quantity

### Respect Communities

- Read subreddit rules carefully
- Don't spam
- Provide genuine value
- Be authentic

### Maintain Activity

- Consistent activity is better than bursts
- Space out comments throughout the day
- Don't max out quotas every day
- Mix in manual comments too

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. ✅ Test single comment workflow
2. ✅ Review and refine personalization
3. ✅ Configure target subreddits
4. ✅ Set up product information
5. ✅ Test batch mode
6. ✅ Monitor and adjust

**Remember:** This is a tool to enhance your Reddit engagement, not replace genuine interaction. Always prioritize authenticity and value.
