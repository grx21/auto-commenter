- **Comment:**
```
autonomous agents that can actually ship code have been the missing piece for a while. curious how the memory/context layer works here.
```

### 2. What's the most underrated way you've seen AI used for actual business tasks?

- **Comment:**
```
for us it was contract review - everyone talks about summarization but having it pull out missing clauses and flag inconsistencies in real vendor docs saved a ton of back and forth.

### 3. Humanity's Pattern of Delayed Harm Intervention Is The Threat, Not AI

- **Comment:**
```
the delayed intervention pattern is real. we're bad at acting on slow-moving risks until they blow up. wonder if ai governance ends up the same.

### 1. Can Notion AI replace a ChatGPT subscription?
- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r2djwt/can_notion_ai_replace_a_chatgpt_subscription/
- **Comment:**
```
i use both for different things. notion ai is decent for in-page stuff and quick drafts but chatgpt handles complex reasoning and coding way better. depends what you need it for.
```

### 2. Best workflow to turn Notion pages into training
- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r2ncpa/best_workflow_to_turn_notion_pages_into_training/
- **Comment:**
```
export to markdown then chunk by section. we use a simple script that splits on headers and keeps metadata. the tricky part is making the chunks meaningful for whatever model you're feeding.
```

### 3. What's your biggest struggle with staying
- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r2qz57/title_whats_your_biggest_struggle_with_staying/
- **Comment:**
```
keeping templates simple enough that i actually use them. built these elaborate systems and then ignored them. now i start minimal and add only what i miss.
```
