# Plan: r/Samaritan_daily Post Guidance — “Stop in Their Tracks” / Slight Controversy

## Goal

Update agent guidelines so that **new posts** in r/Samaritan_daily are written to create a small amount of controversy: they should make people stop scrolling and engage. Posts should be thought-provoking, not bland check-ins.

---

## New Guidance (Summary)

- **Aim:** Slight controversy; posts that make people stop in their tracks.
- **Good patterns:**
  - Pick a Bible passage and **analyze it** (uncommon angle, careful reading, or tension in the text).
  - Claim that a **common concept or verse is often misinterpreted**, and briefly say how or why.
  - Take a **clear, arguable position** on a scriptural or theological point (within sub rules).
- **Boundaries (r/Samaritan_daily rules):**
  - Scripture first; stay on scriptural/theological ground.
  - Respectful; no insults, mockery, or derogatory language.
  - No politics, culture-war, or partisan framing.
  - No spam or off-platform recruitment.

So: “controversy” = thought-provoking, debatable, or “that’s not how I’ve read it” — **not** inflammatory or rule-breaking.

---

## Example Directions (for the agent)

**Avoid (too neutral / low engagement):**
- “Midweek check-in: how’s your week going?”
- “What’s one small thing that helped you recently?”
- “If you could use a listening ear today, drop a line here.”

**Prefer (slight controversy / stop-in-tracks):**
- “Unpopular take: [X common interpretation] of [passage] misses the point. Here’s why.”
- “We quote [verse] for comfort, but in context it’s actually [sterner / more demanding / about Y]. Thoughts?”
- “[Concept, e.g. ‘God won’t give you more than you can handle’] isn’t in the Bible the way we use it. What’s the verse actually saying?”
- “This passage is usually read as [A]. I think it’s really about [B]. Fight me (respectfully).”

## Files to Update

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| **resources/subreddits.md** | Add a short “Post style” subsection under r/Samaritan_daily: slight controversy, stop-in-tracks, with 2–3 bullet examples and one “avoid” vs “prefer” line. |
| **SKILL.md** (Step 2-Samaritan_daily) | In the step where it says “Examples: discussion prompt, weekly check-in style, or short devotional prompt”, replace/expand with: “Posts should have slight controversy: make people stop in their tracks (e.g. analyze a passage, or argue a common interpretation is wrong). See resources/subreddits.md r/Samaritan_daily.” |
| **BATCH.md** | Optional: one line in the r/Samaritan_daily branch: “New posts = slight controversy / stop-in-tracks (see SKILL Step 2-Samaritan_daily and subreddits.md).” |

---

## Proposed Wording (for your refinement)

### 1. resources/subreddits.md — new subsection under §7 r/Samaritan_daily

**Placement:** After the “Activity rule” bullet list, before “Shilling Opportunity”.

**Proposed text:**

```markdown
**Post style: Slight controversy / “stop in their tracks”**
- New posts should be thought-provoking, not neutral. Aim for a small amount of controversy so readers stop scrolling.
- Strong options: (1) Pick a Bible passage and analyze it (uncommon angle or tension). (2) Say a well-known concept or verse is often misinterpreted and briefly explain. (3) Take a clear, arguable position on a scriptural or theological point.
- Stay within sub rules: Scripture first, respectful, no politics/culture-war, no insults.
- Avoid generic check-ins (“How’s your week?”) or purely supportive prompts (“Drop a line if you need a listening ear”). Prefer posts that invite disagreement or “I never read it that way.”
```

### 2. SKILL.md — Step 2-Samaritan_daily, item 3

**Current:**
`3. Create a new post (title + body). Examples: discussion prompt, weekly check-in style, or short devotional prompt. Match subreddit tone from resources/subreddits.md.`

**Proposed:**
`3. Create a new post (title + body). Posts must have slight controversy: make people stop in their tracks (e.g. analyze a Bible passage in an unexpected way, or argue that a common interpretation of a verse or concept is wrong). Avoid bland check-ins or purely supportive prompts. Match subreddit tone and post-style guidance in resources/subreddits.md § r/Samaritan_daily.`

### 3. BATCH.md — optional

**Where:** In the bullet that says “If r/Samaritan_daily: execute SKILL.md Step 2-Samaritan_daily”.

**Proposed addition:**  
`New posts = slight controversy / stop-in-tracks (see SKILL and subreddits.md).`

## Checklist Before You Approve

- [ ] Tone: “Slight” controversy vs “heated” is clear.
- [ ] Examples: enough to guide the agent without being a fixed list.
- [ ] Boundaries: scripture-first and sub rules are explicit.
- [ ] Avoid/prefer examples: you’re happy with “check-ins” and “listening ear” as avoid, and passage analysis / misinterpretation as prefer.
- [ ] Any other subreddit-specific constraints (e.g. length, flair) to add?

## Next Step

Once you refine and approve this plan, the same content will be applied to:
1. `resources/subreddits.md`
2. `SKILL.md` (Step 2-Samaritan_daily)
3. Optionally `BATCH.md`

If you want different examples or a different balance (e.g. more “devotional” vs “debate”), say how you’d like it adjusted and we can update the plan then implement.
