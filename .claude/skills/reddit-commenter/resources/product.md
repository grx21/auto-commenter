## Core Value

**"An AI work OS that turns natural language into reliable execution across your tools."**

- Agentic automation platform
- Connects to SaaS tools and runs "assignments" (tasks described in plain English)
- Builds structured, temporal context so work compounds instead of resetting every time
- Designed to replace brittle workflows with a single interface: say it once, it executes
- Built for operators who want automation without stitching 20 tools together
- Claude cowork with better memory and taste

---

## Target Customer Pain Points

1. Drowning in fragmented tools (email, docs, CRM, calendar, Slack) with no unified context
2. Manual busywork and repeated coordination that never compounds
3. Automation breaking because APIs, permissions, and edge cases change
4. Hard to delegate work cleanly because instructions and context aren't preserved
5. Teams waste time re-explaining "why / what / how" across threads and docs

## Competitor Comparison

| Competitor | Your Differentiation |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Zapier / Make / iPaaS** | Not "if-this-then-that"; runs multi-step work with context and reasoning |
| **RPA tools** | Brittle UI scripts; Sauna is task-as-document + context-aware execution |
| **AI chat assistants** | Chat-only; Sauna produces executable artifacts and persists task state/memory |
| **Workflow SaaS (Asana, Notion)** | Tracking work vs doing work; Sauna actually executes across systems |
| **Claude Code / dev agents** | Code-first; Sauna is tool-first for business workflows and SaaS operations |

---

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1:** Unified natural-language execution across core SaaS (assignments)
2. **Phase 2:** Reusable "task-as-document" library (versioning, reproducibility, team workflows)
3. **Future:** Self-improving work OS (context learning, best-practice playbooks, deeper automation)

## Reddit-Friendly Descriptions

### Product Description
> "Sauna is an AI work OS that executes tasks across your tools from plain English."

### Pain Point Empathy
> "Most ops work is re-explaining context and doing the same coordination every week—this makes it compound."

### Origin Story
> "Built because 'AI chat' wasn't enough—we needed a system that turns instructions into repeatable, executable work."

### Competitor Comparisons
> "If you're tired of brittle zaps/RPA and want context-aware execution that persists, this fits."
