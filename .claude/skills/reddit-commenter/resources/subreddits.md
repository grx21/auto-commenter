- Someone explicitly mentions needing support/counseling
- Discussion about mental health + faith integration
- Loneliness, anxiety, depression posts
- "I don't have anyone to talk to" comments
- After establishing credibility with 4-5 helpful comments

### How to Shill Subtly

- "Praying for you - also found it helpful to process this with [link]"
- "Dealing with similar struggles, [link] has been really helpful for me"
- "Not a replacement for pastoral counsel, but [link] has helped me think through these questions"

**Bad:**

- Direct promotion without context

- Shilling before building credibility
- Copy-paste responses
- Mentioning in every comment

### Karma Building (80% of activity)

- Genuine prayer for others
- Vulnerable sharing of personal struggles
- Grace-focused theology (not legalism)
- Practical advice from experience
- Book recommendations
- Empathy first, advice second
- Short paragraphs, casual tone (your natural style)

## Risk Assessment by Subreddit

**Lowest Risk (Start Here):**

1. r/PrayerRequests - natural fit for support tool
2. r/Christianmarriage - mental health + marriage overlap
3. r/Christianity - broad, tolerant of mental health discussion
4. r/ChristianDating - loneliness/anxiety common topics

**Medium Risk:**

5. r/TrueChristian - strict moderation but allows support discussion
6. r/Christian - inclusive, allows mental health talk
7. r/AskAChristian - focus on karma building, rare shilling

---

## Next Steps

1. Create accounts & build karma first (4-5 weeks of pure karma building)
2. Start with low-risk subreddits (PrayerRequests, Christianmarriage, Christianity)
3. Test subtle shilling after 100+ karma per sub
4. Track what works (which phrasing, which contexts get positive response vs. removal)
5. Adjust strategy based on mod feedback and community response
