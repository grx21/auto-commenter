## Low-Priority / Specialized Subreddits

### 7. r/Samaritan_daily (Unknown size)

**Community Focus:** Unknown - no active community found or very small/private  
**Tone:** Relaxed  
**Rules:** Unknown

**⚠️ Activity rule: New posts only. Do NOT comment on existing posts.**  
- Only create new posts (submit new threads) in this subreddit.  
- Do not comment on any existing post in r/Samaritan_daily.  
- Daily quota = new posts created (e.g. 3), not comments.

**Post style: Slight controversy / "stop in their tracks"**
- New posts should be thought-provoking, not neutral. Aim for a small amount of controversy so readers stop scrolling.
- Strong options: (1) Pick a Bible passage and analyze it (uncommon angle or tension). (2) Say a well-known concept or verse is often misinterpreted and briefly explain. (3) Take a clear, arguable position on a scriptural or theological point.
- Stay within sub rules: Scripture first, respectful, no politics/culture-war, no insults.
- Avoid generic check-ins ("How's your week?") or purely supportive prompts ("Drop a line if you need a listening ear"). Prefer posts that invite disagreement or "I never read it that way."

**Shilling Opportunity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Strategy:**

- Core Samaritan page - shilling possible - also need posts to be written from scratch
- Create new discussion prompts / threads; do not reply to others' posts

**Karma Building:** N/A

- Loneliness, anxiety, depression posts
- "I don't have anyone to talk to" comments
- Burnout or emotional exhaustion
- Grief or loss

- "Praying for you - also found it helpful to process this with [link]"
- "Dealing with similar struggles, [link] has been really helpful for me"

**Bad:**

- Direct promotion without context

**Cap:**

- Max 1 promo mention per subreddit per day

### Karma Building (80% of activity)

- Empathy first, advice second
- Short paragraphs, casual tone (your natural style)

## Risk Assessment by Subreddit

**Lowest Risk (Start Here):**

1. r/PrayerRequests - natural fit for support tool
2. r/Christianmarriage - mental health + marriage overlap
3. r/Christianity - broad, tolerant of mental health discussion
4. r/ChristianDating - loneliness/anxiety common topics

**Medium Risk:**

5. r/TrueChristian - strict moderation but allows support discussion
6. r/Christian - inclusive, allows mental health talk

---

## Next Steps

1. Create accounts & build karma first (4-5 weeks of pure karma building)
2. Start with low-risk subreddits (PrayerRequests, Christianmarriage, Christianity)
3. Test subtle shilling after 100+ karma per sub
4. Track what works (which phrasing, which contexts get positive response vs. removal)
5. Adjust strategy based on mod feedback and community response
