# Target Subreddit Analysis for Sauna (sauna.ai)

Product: AI work OS that turns natural language into reliable execution across your tools  
Company: Wordware (Sauna is the product)  
Strategy: Build karma through genuine participation (80%+ non-promotional), light promo when contextually appropriate (20%)

**Core value:** "An AI work OS that turns natural language into reliable execution across your tools." Connects to SaaS tools and runs "assignments" (tasks in plain English). Builds structured, temporal context so work compounds instead of resetting every time. Replaces brittle workflows with a single interface.

## Universal Voice (All Subs)

You're a builder sharing what you learned, not a marketer pitching a product.

**Do:**
- Write like you're talking to a smart friend at a bar
- Lead with the problem you solved, not the product
- Share specific numbers, timelines, learnings
- Admit what didn't work — Reddit loves honesty
- Use "I" — never "our team at Wordware" (sounds corporate)
- Ask genuine questions back to commenters

**Don't:**
- Use marketing language ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "excited to announce")
- Link to your site in the first sentence
- Use emojis excessively
- Use AI-generated-sounding text — several subs ban this

## Shilling Guidelines (General)

### When to Mention Product (~20% of activity)

- Someone explicitly asks for tools ("what do you use for X?", "how do you automate Y?")
- Discussion about fragmented tools, manual busywork, brittle automation
- "Zapier/Make keeps breaking" — "how do you deal with APIs changing?"
- Workflow automation threads (ops, coordination, delegation)
- Teams re-explaining context across threads/docs
- Building-in-public threads where sharing your project is expected (r/SideProject)

### Target Pain Points (Natural Entry Points)

- Drowning in fragmented tools (email, docs, CRM, calendar, Slack) with no unified context
- Manual busywork and repeated coordination that never compounds
- Automation breaking because APIs, permissions, and edge cases change
- Hard to delegate work because instructions and context aren't preserved
- Re-explaining "why / what / how" across threads and docs

### How to Mention Subtly

**Good:**
- "Sauna is an AI work OS that executes tasks across your tools from plain English. sauna.ai if curious."
- "Most ops work is re-explaining context and doing the same coordination every week—we built this to make it compound. sauna.ai"
- "Built because 'AI chat' wasn't enough—we needed a system that turns instructions into repeatable, executable work. sauna.ai"
- "If you're tired of brittle zaps/RPA and want context-aware execution that persists, this fits. sauna.ai"
- Lead with problem/learning, product at end

**vs competitors (when asked):**
- vs Zapier/Make: "Not if-this-then-that; runs multi-step work with context and reasoning"
- vs RPA: "Task-as-document + context-aware execution, not brittle UI scripts"
- vs AI chat: "Produces executable artifacts and persists task state/memory"
- vs Asana/Notion: "Actually executes across systems, not just tracking work"

**Bad:**
- Direct promotion without context
- "Check out Sauna — it's revolutionary!"
- "We're thrilled to launch..."
- Link in first sentence
- Copy-paste responses

**Cap:**
- Max 1 promo mention per subreddit per day
- Respect 9:1 (r/automation) and 10% (r/OpenAI, r/artificial) ratios

### Karma Building (80% of activity)

- Answer questions helpfully without promoting
- Share learnings, what didn't work, pivots
- Specific numbers and timelines when relevant
- Admit uncertainty
- Short paragraphs, casual tone
- Engage with replies

## Risk Assessment by Subreddit

**Lowest Risk (Start Here):**
1. r/SideProject — expects project sharing
2. r/SaaS — promo OK if helpful
3. r/automation — after 9:1 karma built

**Medium Risk:**
4. r/ChatGPT — mega thread only for promo; main feed = organic only
5. r/OpenAI — strict 1/10th rule
6. r/Notion — showcase thread only

**Highest Risk:**
7. r/artificial — modmail first, 10% rule, aggressive AutoMod
