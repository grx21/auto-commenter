# Reddit Commenter - Batch Mode

> Executed when "Fill today's quota" command given
> See SKILL.md for single comment workflow

---

## Batch Execution Trigger

Start batch mode with these commands:
- "Fill today's quota"
- "Consume all remaining quota"
- "Run in batch mode"

---

## Pre-Start Check

```
1. Check tracking/reddit/today's-date.md (create from template.md if missing)
2. Check current comment count by subreddit
3. Calculate remaining quota:
   - Total 21 (7 subreddits × 3)
   - Subtract today's written comments
   - Remaining quota = 21 - Today's written comments
```

---

## Batch Workflow

```
[Start]
    ↓
[1] Check tracking file (/tracking/reddit/(today's date).md) → Calculate remaining quota
    ↓
[2] Select subreddit under quota (by priority criteria)
    ↓
[3] Start comment writing loop for that subreddit
    ↓
    [3-1] Execute SKILL.md Step 1-8 (write single comment)
    ↓
    [3-2] Update tracking file
    ↓
    [3-3] Report progress
    ↓
    [3-4] Check that subreddit's quota
          - Under 3 → back to [3-1]
          - Completed 3 → to [4]
          - No suitable posts → to [4]
    ↓
[4] Move to next subreddit (wait 5-15 minutes)
    ↓
[5] Check overall termination condition
    ↓
    YES → [End]
    NO  → Return to [2]
```
