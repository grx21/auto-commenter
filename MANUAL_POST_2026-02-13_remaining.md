```
i use it for brainstorming and structure but write the actual thing myself. when i do let it draft i edit heavily... otherwise it sounds like everyone else's post.

- **Comment:**
```
the wrong spirals and overconfidence thing is real. i've had better luck asking for confidence and sources in custom instructions but it's inconsistent.
```

- **Comment:**
```
autonomous agents that can actually ship code have been the missing piece for a while. curious how the memory/context layer works here.
```

```
for us it was contract review - everyone talks about summarization but having it pull out missing clauses and flag inconsistencies in real vendor docs saved a ton of back and forth.
```

- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1r3dja8/humanitys_pattern_of_delayed_harm_intervention_is/
- **Comment:**
```
the delayed intervention pattern is real. we're bad at acting on slow-moving risks until they blow up. wonder if ai governance ends up the same.

### 1. Quick Question: All-In-One systems or Specific Small systems?
- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r42zvu/quick_question_do_you_guys_get_more_productive/

```
i'm faster with one place for tasks and one for notes, but it has to be lightweight on mobile or i end up not opening it.
```

### 2. How do I get rid of AI on notion?
- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r42l1x/how_do_i_get_rid_of_ai_on_notion/
- **Comment:**
```
support can turn it off for you, or use notion in a browser with an extension to hide the ai bits. no clean in-app toggle yet.
```

### 3. Notion 3rd Party Automation Help
- **URL:** https://old.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1r42835/notion_3rd_party_automation_help/
- **Comment:**
```
for pdf to structured data we use make plus a simple script that parses the pdf. make handles the notion side once you have the fields. the pdf parsing part is the annoying bit... there are pdf to json tools that might help.
```
