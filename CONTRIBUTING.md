## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

1. **Bug Reports**: Found a bug? Open an issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment details

2. **Feature Requests**: Have an idea? Open an issue with:
   - Clear use case
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternative solutions considered

3. **Code Contributions**:
   - Bug fixes
   - New features
   - Documentation improvements
   - Platform additions (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)

### Before You Start

- Check if an issue already exists
- For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
- Make sure your idea aligns with project goals

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Markdown Files

- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where appropriate
- Use tables for structured data
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters when possible)

### Documentation

- All new features must include documentation
- Update README.md if adding major features
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Personalization Files

- Must follow the template structure
- Include diverse examples (short, long, various tones)
- Provide clear criteria for each checklist item
- Avoid overly specific personal details

---

## Adding New Platforms

To add support for a new platform (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn):

### 1. Create Platform Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/[platform]-commenter/resources
mkdir -p tracking/[platform]
```

### 2. Create Required Files

- `.claude/skills/[platform]-commenter/SKILL.md` - Single comment workflow
- `.claude/skills/[platform]-commenter/BATCH.md` - Batch workflow
- `.claude/skills/[platform]-commenter/resources/personalization_[platform].md` - Style guide
- `.claude/skills/[platform]-commenter/resources/subreddits.md` - Community guide (adapt naming)
- `.claude/skills/[platform]-commenter/resources/product.md` - Product info template
- `tracking/[platform]/template.md` - Tracking template
- `leads/[platform].md` - Leads template

### 3. Adapt for Platform Specifics

Consider:
- Character limits (e.g., Twitter's 280 chars)
- Platform-specific features (threads, hashtags, etc.)
- API limitations
- Rate limiting rules
- Community guidelines

### 4. Update Documentation

- Add platform to main README.md
- Create platform-specific setup guide
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md with platform-specific notes

### 5. Test Thoroughly

- Test single comment workflow
- Test batch mode
- Verify personalization works
- Check rate limiting behavior

---
