                        - paragraph [ref=e636]: back then you had things like morals/values/moral majority/etc - people who saw the republicans as the moral and christian voice. It was all a farce much like the televangelists.
                        - paragraph [ref=e637]: You have only to look back at what they said then and how they reacted to, let's say clinton and the intern, to see how hypocritical people on the right were and are now.
                        - paragraph [ref=e638]: That is one of many reasons that, while still a registered Independent, I vote for dems. People on the right tend to worship a figure, trump currently, and put aside their bible to follow him. They buy his hats, flags, etc, and spend more time praising him than they do spreading the good news. Ask yourself why.
                        - paragraph [ref=e639]: The televangelists preach about sending them money - and they take it and buy expensive homes and then cheat on their wives and lie. Just like trump does. They are both the same in that they use your faith to get your money and to get power.
                        - paragraph [ref=e640]: At least with dems you know what they stand for up front - helping those in need, raising taxes on the wealthy, freedom of choice, gay rights, etc - and they don't use the bible to sit around and justify it all. The right NEEDS religious people to get power, they see most are christian here in the US, and then use their bible to convince you that if you don't vote for them and all they say you are going to hell.
                        - paragraph [ref=e641]: Conservatism is a cancer that uses religion (from the Taliban to Saudi Arabia to Trump) to empower the few to push their brand and interpretation onto others. Both parties may do some of the same thing here in the US but both are not the same. You can choose to vote for the party that uses the bible to hurt people or you can choose to vote for the party that doesn't tie itself to any religion.
